Test verifies if ei_ncs library properly forwards the data between application and the Edge Impulse library.
The test uses mocked version of the Edge Impulse library.
The mocked library only verifies if input values are the same as assumed and returns predefined output values.
Expected input and output values depend on prediction index to make sure that they are properly updated.

Input and output for given prediction index are defined in ei_test_params.h file.
Input data must be ascending sequence of floats.
Difference between subsequent elements of input sequence equals 1.
